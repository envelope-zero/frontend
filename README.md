# Envelope Zero frontend

Envelope Zero is fundamentally rooted in two ideas:

- Using the [envelope method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_system) to budget expenses into envelopes.
- Zero Based Budeting, meaning that you assign all your money to an envelope. Saving for a vacation? Create an envelope and archive it after your vacation. Rent? Create an envelope that gets a fixed amount of money added every month.
