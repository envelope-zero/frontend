# Envelope Zero frontend

Check out the documentation at [envelope-zero.org](https://envelope-zero.org)!

## Deployment

The frontend currently has two requirements:

- The API needs to be available at the same hostname with the prefix `/api`
- Only `v1` of the API is supported

## Supported Versions

This project is under heavy development. Therefore, only the latest release is supported.

Please check the [releases page](https://github.com/envelope-zero/frontend/releases) for the latest release.

Check the table below for the minimal required frontend version for specific [backend](https://github.com/envelope-zero/backend) versions.

Please note that below version 1.0.0, any new minor version for the backend might break compatibility.
